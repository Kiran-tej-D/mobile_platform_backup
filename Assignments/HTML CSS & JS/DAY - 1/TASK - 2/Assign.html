                    Ayodhya was historically known as Saketa. The early Buddhist and Jain canonical texts mention that
                    the religious
                    leaders Gautama Buddha
                    and Mahavira visited and lived in the city. The Jain texts also describe it as the birthplace of
                    five
                    tirthankaras namely, Rishabhanatha,
                    Ajitanatha, Abhinandananatha, Sumatinatha and Anantanatha, and associate it with the legendary
                    Bharata
                    Chakravarti. From the Gupta period
                    onwards, several sources mention Ayodhya and Saketa as the name of the same city.

                    The legendary city of Ayodhya, popularly identified as the present-day Ayodhya, is identified in the
                    epic
                    Ramayana and its many versions as the birthplace of the Hindu deity Rama of Kosala and is hence
                    regarded
                    as
                    the
                    first of the seven most important pilgrimage sites for Hindus.[8][10] The Ayodhya dispute was
                    centered
                    on the
                    Babri mosque, built 1528â€“29 under the Mughal emperor Babur and said to have replaced a temple that
                    stood
                    at
                    the
                    birth spot of Rama.[11] In 1992 a Hindu mob demolished the mosque, provoking riots throughout the
                    Indian
                    subcontinent.[12][13] In 2019 the Supreme Court of India ruled that the land belonged to the
                    government
                    per
                    tax
                    records, and ordered it to be handed over to a trust to build a Hindu temple. It also ordered the
                    government to
                    give an alternative 2.0 hectares (5 acres) of land to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board to
                    build
                    another mosque, the land for which was acquired by the Government in Dhannipur in Ayodhya district
                    and
                    handed
                    over to the Board. The construction of Ram Mandir commenced in August 2020 and the temple was
                    consecrated
                    with
                    the deity of Balak Ram on 22 January 2024
